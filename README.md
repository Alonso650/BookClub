# BookLink
This project was based off a class on the Udemy website https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/. 
The reason why I worked on this side project was because I was interested in learning more about full stack web development 
and wanting to learn more about http requests and how they work. The project that I worked on is called BookLink which is 
like a blog site which allows users to create their own profiles and within their own profiles they can create book entries. 
Each book entry that gets created allows there to be a comment section where other users can leave a comment on the book entry. 
All the information gets stored into a database using MongoDB.  

The languages/technologies that I used in this project are JavaScript (Node.js), HTML/CSS, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. This project 
is still in progress because I am still making updates to it, but it really taught me about using http requests such as GET, POST, 
PUT, DELETE and using some of the requests together. It also really taught me on how JavaScript can be used in hand with HTML to 
display data on specific webpages. To be able to run the web-based application, the user has to be inside of the BookLink folder 
and run node app.js on the terminal and it will be on localhost:3000.
